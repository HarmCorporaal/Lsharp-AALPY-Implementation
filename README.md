## Lsharp Implementation
This implementation is part of my bachelor thesis at the Radboud University.
The implementation is made so it fits the structure used in the [AALpy library](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy). 
The implementation is incorporated into the AALpy library and can be found under [deterministic algorithms](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/tree/master/aalpy/learning_algs/deterministic).
